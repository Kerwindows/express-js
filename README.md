# This is my personal experimentation with Node and express

In package.json each example will execute based on the key value pair in the scripts object

## Install

`npm i express`
`npm i nodemon --save--dev to save` to devDepedancies

## Run

*npm run startExpress1*
or
*npm run startExpress2*
or
*npm run startExpress3*
or
*npm run startReadfile*

To run a script in node without express add "type":"module" to package.json
